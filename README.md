# Polarization Lab
The following is a description of 8 experiments conducted to explore the properties of light such as polarization and birefringence. Each experiment has the functions called to conduct it, as well as containing the filename for the source data of each experiment. This project also includes the firmware used in the arduino, the two drivers designed to communicate with the arduino and photodetector, the experiment file, and the full lab report.
